			<p> 
			I retired from the University of Michigan at the end of my appointment in May 2021 after four mostly
			wonderful years here.  Before this, I was at the University of Washington Bothell for four years in the electrical
			engineering department.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			While here at Michigan, I taught <a href="https://eecs280.org">EECS 280</a> C++ and Object-Oriented Programming
			many times, typically with around 1000 to 1100 students spread across 5 sections with 3 or 4 instructors
			and around 60 very gifted student staff. Summer 2020, I taught <a href="eecs482ss20/index.html">EECS 482</a> Introduction
			to Operating Systems, a topic I've always enjoyed.	Winter 2021, I taught <a href="https://eecs485.org">EECS 485</a>
			Web Systems for the first time and <a href="eecs440w21/index.html">EECS 440</a> System Design of a Search Engine for
			fourth time, but for the first and last time with its new permanent number.  This is a course I created where students
			worked in teams of six to build complete internet search engines from scratch in C++. The last two times I taught this, the top
			teams indexed over 500M documents. (My 440 and 482 archives have links to my lecture recordings.)
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I also served as our <a href="https://www.abet.org/">ABET</a> coordinator and, in past years, on our
			program and lecturer search committees and as an undergraduate advisor.
			</p>
			
			<h4><a name="Credentials"></a>Credentials</h4>
			
			<p>
			I have a BS and MS EE from Stanford (1973) and an MBA valedictorian from
			Boston University (1987).  I am a life senior member of the IEEE and a registered
			professional engineer in Texas and Massachusetts. In 2014, I was
			inducted as an eminent engineer by the Stanford chapter of Tau Beta Pi.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I have 11 issued patents and my publications have received over
			<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6j7pvpIHC9wC&hl=en">
			3200 citations</a>.  A paper on search engine ranking I co-authored
			at Microsoft won a <a href="https://icml.cc/2015/index.html%3Fp=51.html">
			<i>10-year test-of-time award</i></a> at the 2015 International
			Conference on Machine Learning.
			</p>
			
			<h4><a name="Career"></a>Career</h4>
			
			<p>
			I have spent my career as a designer, most of that as an entrepreneur.  Every
			design project I can think of that I have ever worked on has always started
			as a blank sheet of paper.  This is what I think I can teach.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I started my career in gate-level chip design at IBM in the 1970s building
			a reliable serial communications chip, a display processor and various other
			hardware devices.  But most of my work has been in software.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I'm the author of <a href="https://hamiltonlabs.com/Cshell.htm">Hamilton C shell</a>,
			now a little over 250K lines of C.  In December 1988, my C shell became the first
			multithreaded third-party application to ship on a PC.  It remains the only
			multithreaded Unix shell in existence on any OS.
			</p>			
			
			<p>
			I was also the 9th member of the team at Microsoft that created the Bing
			search engine.  I personally wrote the query language (the compiler) and ranker
			for our first release, which went live in January 2005.  My code, roughly 30K
			lines of C++ out of a little over 300K in the backend, decided what our users
			were looking for, searched our index and then ordered the results.  This was
			both the best and the worst job I have ever had.
			</p>
						
			<h4><a name="MyAccidentalPath"></a>My accidental path to Ann Arbor</h4>
		
			<p>
			I fell into teaching by accident in 2013.  I thought I was retired and volunteering to act as
			a free advisor to seniors in electrical engineering on their Capstone projects at the University
			of Washington Bothell. I was surprised to find it paid and even more so, that they would pay
			me.  Without a PhD, it was never on my radar that I would someday be teaching at a university.  For
			the next four years, I taught digital design and Verilog, entrepreneurship, circuits and
			transistors and advised perhaps a dozen Capstone teams. I love teaching and feel honored and
			delighted every day that I get to do this.  I love working with my students.  It makes me feel young.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The move to Michigan also began quite by accident when I went offline at Wikipedia to discuss an article on
			flip-flops that another editor and I had been working on.  Most people use pseudonyms on Wikipedia but
			when we went offline and introduced ourselves, it was <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~brehob/">Mark Brehob</a>,
			who insisted I should come to Michigan.  I wasn't looking forward to moving but decided that my advice to
			students applied to me:  If you care about your career, you need to go where the opportunity is.  University
			of Michigan has the #7 undergraduate computer engineering program in the country, so after a visit and
			<a href="https://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/viewer/r/hrssfl">teaching demo</a> and when it finally
			came down to an offer, it was clearly an offer I couldn't refuse.  I mothballed my house in Redmond,
			rented a townhouse here without ever seeing it, shipped only what I needed and drove here with my
			cat in the back seat of my aging BMW.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I had a wonderful time here.  My students are smart and interesting and I really liked most of my colleagues.  The move
			was definitely worth it, even if in the end, I decided it was time to head home to Seattle.
			</p>
						
			<h4><a name="Personal"></a>Personal</h4>
			
			<p>
			I'm an Amateur Extra, callsign KD1UJ, though I confess I haven't been
			on the air in years.  I've been an avid bicyclist all my life.  I'm liberal and I
			care deeply about civil rights, especially for LGBT.
