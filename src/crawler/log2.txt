how
old
well
when
doing
an
archeological
dig
for
golf
history
best
to
start
by
digging
in
the
auld
sod
scotland
here
we
find
that
in
1843
allan
robertson
of
st
andrews
played
another
scot
willie
dunn
in
a
renowned
challenge
match
20
rounds
in
10
days
on
the
old
course
at
st
andrews
robertson
ahead
by
two
rounds
with
one
to
play
was
declared
the
winner
it
was
not
the
first
challenge
match
but
given
robertson’s
place
in
golf
history—the
best
player
of
his
era
a
member
of
the
world
golf
hall
of
fame
and
by
some
accounts
the
first
golf
professional—it’s
a
good
place
to
begin
professional
matches
first
reported
in
st
andrews
in
the
1830s
were
common
by
the
1840s
the
british
golf
museum
website
says
the
stakes
which
were
often
high
were
put
up
by
backers
rather
than
the
players
at
the
time
these
matches
were
the
only
way
professionals
could
make
money
actually
playing
the
game
though
perhaps
earning
less
than

some

one
of
the
most
memorable
challenge
matches
of
the
era
was
a
three
rounder
20
holes
each
that
robertson
and
old
tom
morris
played
against
brothers
willie

tom
dunn
at
stake
was

an
enormous
sum
in

days
the
match
was
tied

into

third
round
when
robertson
and
morris
overcame
a
four
hole
deficit
with
eight
to
play
winning
six
straight
holes
to
prevail
the
scots
naturally
exported
the
challenge
match
to
the
united

once
there
these
events
became

spectacles
that
could
be

nelson
had
played
35
exhibition
matches
by
the
end
of
february
1943
one
of
the
most
famous
challenge
matches
worthy
of
an
entire
book
by
noted
author
mark
frost
titled
simply
the
match
occurred
at
cypress
point
in
1956
it
was
suggested
by
eddie
lowery
a
successful
car
dealer
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
who
as
a
boy
was
on
the
bag
when
amateur
francis
ouimet’s
famously
won
the
1913
u.s
open
at
brookline
lowery
boasted
he
had
two
amateurs
working
for
him
who
could
beat
any
two
players
professionals
included
in
a
best
ball
match
so
it
was
that
ben
hogan
and
nelson
agreed
to
play
the
amateurs
ken
venturi
and
harvie
ward
the
scores
hogan

venturi

and
nelson
and
ward
67s
reportedly
all
bets
were
forgiven
in
the
wake
of
astounding
and
memorable
golf
television
soon
recognized
an
opportunity
in
the
interest
of
ratings
to
spotlight
some
of
the
game’s
elite
by
staging
series
of
matches
the
professionals
also
recognized
an
opportunity
to
bolster
their
bottom
lines
transitioning
challenge
matches
back
away
from
philanthropy
and
into
a
commercial
enterprise
in
1961
shell’s
wonderful
world
of
golf
debuted
with
a
match
between
billy
casper
and
mario
gonzalez
in
rio

the
show
ran
through
1970
and
returned
in
1994
for
another
10
year
run
byron
nelson
and
sam

meanwhile
the
era
of
the
big
three—arnold
palmer

nicklaus
and
gary

evolving
and
the

golf
a
series
of

and

in

1980s
challenge
matches
morphed
into
the
skins
game
the

becoming
a

for

fans
until

on

from
1999
through
2005—the
showdown
at

the

at

and
the

they
aired
on
abc
television
though
the
ratings
steadily
declined
each
year
after
the
second
event
in
2012
it
returned
once
more
with
a
woods
rory
mcilroy
match
the
duel
at

jinsha
in

the
concept
was
resurrected
again
in
2018
on
the
day
after
thanksgiving
woods
played
phil
mickelson
in
the
match
a
pay

event
that
played
to
tepid
reviews
and
is
unlikely
to
have
a

written
about
it
last

circle
of

with
charities
being
the
big
beneficiary
while
also
sating
for
the
moment
an
audience
starved
for
fresh
action
however
these
matches
play
out
they
will
face
a

about
ischemia
what
does
ischemia
mean
ischemia
is
a
shortage
of
blood
supply
to
a
part
of
the
body
because
of
a
blockage
or
because
an
artery
blood
vessel
is
too
tight
proper
blood
flow
is
important
for
many
things
including
for
circulating
oxygen
throughout
the
body
which
means
that
ischemia
is
often
a
serious
problem
the
word
is
typically
used
in
a
medical
context
to
refer
to
insufficient
blood
flow
to
major
organs
which
can
cause
significant
health
problems
such
as
a
heart
attack
or
stroke
the
adjective
form
ischemic
is
used
when
describing
specific
cases
of
blood
shortage
such
as
ischemic
heart
disease
or
an
ischemic
stroke
why
is
ischemia
important
even
if
you
don’t
know
much
about
blood
you
probably
know
that
it
is
important
and
that
something
really
bad
would
happen
if
your
major
organs
didn’t
get
it
doctors
have
known
this
for
a
long
time
and
have
a
specific
term
for
when
blood
is
prevented
from
getting
to
where
it
needs
to
go
medical
experts
have
referred
to
this
condition
as
ischemia
since
at
least
the
1800s
the
word
ischemia
comes
from
the
greek
ischein
meaning
to
suppress
and
the
suffix
emia
which
is
used
in
terms
involving
blood
such
as
anemia
ischemia
is
a
blood
supply
shortage
due
to
something
preventing
the
right
amount
of
blood
from
reaching
its
destination
this
could
happen
for
a
variety
of
reasons
but
one
of
the
most
common
is
a
buildup
of
cholesterol
or
fat
in
the
arteries
the
tubes
in
your
body
that
take
blood
to
where
it
needs
to
go
this
causes
the
arteries
to
tighten
or
become
blocked
entirely
in
the
form
of
a
blood
clot
ischemia
can
potentially
occur
anywhere
that
blood
flows
in
the
body
but
it
is
a
serious
issue
regardless
of
where
it
happens
the
reason
ischemia
is
so
serious
is
that
blood
transports
important
proteins
and
oxygen
to
tissues
and
organs
if
the
supply
of
these
nutrients
is
cut
off
then
major
organs
will
suffer
from
deficiencies
will
be
unable
to
perform
cellular
metabolism
and
will
eventually
die
the
symptoms
of
ischemia
are
often
related
to
the
organ
or
area
that
is
short
of
blood
cerebral
brain
ischemia
can
cause
blindness
or
unconsciousness
symptoms
of
myocardial
heart
ischemia
include
chest
pain
nausea
and
fatigue
the
health
problems
that
are
caused
by
ischemia
can
range
from
incredible
pain
in
the
limbs
to
life
threatening
medical
emergencies
such
as
heart
attacks
or
strokes
ischemia
is
not
easily
treated
and
often
requires
major
surgery
or
a
major
change
in
lifestyle
in
order
to
resolve
current
problems
or
prevent
any
future
health
issues
did
you
know
while
ischemia
often
has
symptoms
such
as
pain
or
nausea
sometimes
a
person
can
have
ischemia

right
about
now
not
alone
in
most
countries
the
government
essentially
does
your
taxes
for
you
but
in
the
united
states
there
is
a
unique
system
with
its
own
vocabulary
that
residents
and
citizens
have
to
navigate
every
year
between
the
beginning
of
january
and

the

on
which
a
person
or
company
reports
income
wages
deductions

and
any
other
important
tax
information
your

the
form
you
file
with
the

that
tells
you
and
them
what
your
tax
payment
is
or
how
much

the

everyone

federal
income
tax
income
tax
is
a
tax
paid
on
incomes
which
for
most
people
means
the
money
they
earn
from
their
employer
or
money
they
earn
from
their
business
other
forms
of
income
that
can
be
taxed
include
rents
capital
gains
and
winnings
from
gambling
and
the
lottery
federal

tax
is
the
income
tax
a
person
pays
to
the
federal
government
federal
income
tax
is
what
most
people
refer
to
when
they
generally
talk
about
paying
taxes
federal
income
tax
is
calculated
by
a
number
of
factors
including
a
person’s

deductions
credits
and
exemptions
form
1040
the
key
form
needed
to
complete
an
annual
tax
return
is
the
form
1040
or
1040
for
short
to
this
main
document
additional
forms
known
as
forms
or
schedules
may
be
added
depending
on
the
situation
every
year
the
irs
issues
a
new
version
of
the
form
1040
for
that
year
adjusted
gross
income
agi
in
business
gross
means
amount
of
salary
or
profit
before
deductions
or
so
your
gross
income
refers
to
how
much
money
you
made
before
taxes
and
other
deductions
the
adjusted
part
is
a
little
more
complex
the
irs
has
a
complicated
system
of
allowances
exemptions
and
credits
that
we
will
get
into
in
a
minute
but
basically
there
is
a
list
of
things
that
allowed
to
deduct
from
your
gross
income
before
you
even
get
into
any
of
those
other
options
for
example
if
you
are
a
teacher
you
can
deduct
up
to
300
spent
out
of
pocket
on
classroom
expenses
from
your
gross
income
there
are
other
adjustments
available
including
health
savings
accounts
hsas
self
employment
health
insurance
premiums
and
ira
deposits
so
if
you
are
a
teacher
who
made
50,000/year
before
taxes
and
you
spent
250
on
your
classroom
that
year
and
then
you
put
750
in
your
health
savings
account
your
agi
would
be
50,000

learn
more
about
its

and
uses
withholding
as
you
can
see
withholding
also
known
as
tax
withholding
or
withholding
tax
is
a
portion
of
an
employee’s
wages
that
an
employer
takes
from
their
pay
and
gives
directly
to
the
government
most
employees
will
already
have
had
money
taken
out
of
their
pay
before
they
receive
their
paycheck
how
much
money
a
company
withholds
from
an
employee
depends
on
how
much
the
employee
makes
and
the
employee’s

form
deductions
deduction
means
take
away
from
or
which
is
exactly
what
deductions
do
to
the
amount
of
taxes
you
owe
the
word
might
make
you
think
of
the
way
detective
holmes
solves
mysteries
but
it
has
less
to
do
with
logic
and
more
to
do
with
simple
math
there
are
two
kinds
of
deductions
that
you
can
take
standard
and
itemized
these
are
different
from
the
adjustments
we
mentioned
earlier
because
these
deductions
are
taken
from
your
adjusted
gross
income
not
your
gross
income
standard
deduction
every
year
the
irs
sets
amounts
known
as
the
standard
deduction
there
are
different
amounts
of
standard
deductions
depending
on
whether
you
file
as
single
married
or
head
of
household
itemized
deductions
if
you
are
a
real
devil
for
the
details
and
appreciate
precision
you
probably
like
itemized
lists
of
things
your
best
friend
may
think
she
has
and
in
her
purse
but
you
would
be
happy
to
give
her
an
itemized
list
of
all
the
items
she
has
two
lipsticks
a
lip
balm
tissues
floss
and
three
peppermints
itemized
deductions
are
also
a
list
but
instead
of
a
list
of
a
contents
a
list
of
what
you
are
deducting
there
are
many
things
that
can
be
considered
itemized
deductions
and
it
changes
every
year
some
examples
of
things
that
can
be
itemized
are
medical
and
dental
expenses
and
charitable
contributions
you
have
to
pick
either
the
standard
or
itemized
deductions
when
you
file
your
form
1040
typically
unless
you
donate
a
lot
of
money
to
charity
it
is
more
beneficial
to
take
the
standard
deduction
your
deductions
are
taken
from

tax
exempt
certain
assets
or
income
are
considered
tax
exempt
exempt
means
be
free
from
obligation
or
if
something
is
tax
exempt
you
are
free
from
the
obligation
or
duty
to
pay
taxes
on
it
one
common
example
of
tax
exempt
income
is
the
interest
earned
on
municipal
bonds
anything
that
is
tax
exempt
is
yours
to
keep
credits
in
order
to
encourage
certain
behaviors
like
investing
in
green
energy
or
to
help
out
certain
populations
the
government
will
offer
tax
credits
while
we
think
of
credit
as
recognition
for
something
in
bookkeeping
credit
has
a
slightly
different
meaning
the
amount
of
money
received
basically
tax
credits
are
like
the
government
giving
you
a
check
hooray
the
most
common
credit
people
will
receive
is
the
earned
income
tax
credit
also
known
as
eic
or
eitc
one
of
the
biggest
economic
support
programs
in
the
united
states
the
eic
is
a
sliding
scale
credit
if
you
earn
no
money
you
get
no
eic
if
you
make
some
money
you
will
get
an
eic
based
on
how
much
you
earned
and
how
many
dependents
like
children
you
have
if
you
make
more
than
a
certain
amount
you
will
no
longer
get
an
eic
taxable
income
taxable
income
is
the
portion
of
income
that
a
government
uses
to
calculate
how
much
tax
a
person
or
company
will
owe
speaking
generally
taxable
income
is
determined
by
taking
a
person’s
or
company’s
agi
and
subtracting
all
applicable
deductions
from
it
after
doing
all
of
the
searching
compiling
and
calculating
taxable
income
is
the
magic
number
that
you
will
finally
be
able
to
use
when
determining
how
much
you
actually
owe
in
taxes
filing
status
a
person’s
filing
status
is
the
other
main
factor
besides
taxable
income
that
determines
their
income
tax
rate
which
is
the
percentage
used
to
calculate
federal
income
tax
filing
is
based
on
a
person’s
marital
status
and
whether
or
not
they
have
any
dependents
living
with
them
the
filing
status
determines
how
high
a
person’s
taxable
income
needs
to
be
before
they
owe
a
higher
percentage
of
income
as
taxes
there
are
five
different
types
of
filing
status
single
married
filing
jointly
married
filing
separately
head
of
household
and
widow(er
with
dependent
when
dealing
with

learn
how
to
talk
about
it
accurately
learn
the
difference
between
economic
and
economical
w
2
vs
w
4
vs
w
9
one
of
the
things
that
makes
filing
your
annual
tax
return
so
daunting
is
the
confusing
names
of
the
forms
because
they
are
so
similar
take
for
example
the
w
2
w
4
and
w
9
if
you
are
a
salaried
employee
when
you
first
started
the
job
you
filled
out
a
w
4
that
is
where
you
help
your
employer
figure
out
your
withholdings
at
the
end
of
the
year
typically
before
the
end
of
january
your
employer
will
give
you
a
w
2
on
the
w
2
you
will
find
information
about
how
much
you
were
paid
that
year
and
how
much
was
deducted
for
taxes
this
information
is
critical
for
completing
form
1040
if
you
are
a
freelancer
or
independent
contractor
like
an
uber
driver
you
filled
out
a
w
9
when
you
first
began
working
with
the
company
you
will
not
get
a
w
2
at
the
end
of
the
year
but
you
might
get
a
1099
not
sure
what
that
is
read
on
1098
vs
1099
a
1099
is
a
statement
of
income
other
than
wages
there
are
different
types
of
1099
forms
but
they
include
income
like
contractual
earnings
or
rental
property
earnings
unlike
your
w
2
you
may
or
may
not
receive
a
1099
although
you
can
always
request
one
a
1098
is
a
statement
that
you
can
use
for
itemized
deductions
if
you
choose
to
a
1098
is
a
statement
of
how
much
money
was
paid
on
the
interest
for
a
mortgage
loan
similarly
1098
e
statements
are
specific
to
student
loans
because
if
not
one
loan
in
our
life
refund
vs
liability
after
you
get
all
your
paperwork
together
and
fill
out
your
form
1040
and
all
the
other
schedules
you
may
or
may
not
need
left
with
one
of
two
numbers
at
the
end
either
a
refund
or
a
liability
if
lucky
you
will
get
a
refund
when
you
pay
more
than
you
owe
in
taxes
you
will
get
a
refund
a
word
dating
back
to
the
1400s
that
means
give
this
refund
includes
tax
credits
that
you
are
eligible
for
if
you
pay
enough
in
taxes
over
the
year
you
will
have
a
liability
liability
is
a
slightly
fancy
word
for
you
if
you
end
up
with
a
jaw
dropping
amount
of
liability
when
you
file
your
taxes

audit
an
a
udit
is
an
official
examination
of
financial
accounts
and
statements
in
the
united
states
tax
audits
are
handled
by
the
irs
as
part
of
the
audit
the
irs
will
typically
request
documentation
and
conduct
interviews
so
they
can
accurately
determine
what
the
correct
tax
payment
or
refund
should
be
a
person
or—more
likely—a
business
can
be
selected
for
an
audit
for
a
variety
of
reasons
but
it
usually
occurs
due
to
inaccuracies
or
suspicious
activity
during
the
tax
filing
process
for

the
irs
may
audit
a
business
that

suspiciously

low
alcohol
beer
in
the
u.s
long
has
suffered
from
an
image
problem
namely
the
perception
that
low
and
no
alcohol
brews
taste
bad
from
salon
that’s
because
the
brewing
process
can
be
especially
complicated
for
low
or
no
alcohol
ferments
which
has
made
it
difficult
to
brew
high
quality
low
alcohol
beer
that
tastes
good
from

some
even
say
that
budweiser
isn’t
given
nearly
enough
credit
for
brewing
a
consistent
relatively
palatable
low
alcohol
product
at
such
a
big
scale
from

in

several
studies

in

way
the
figurative
use
of
tunnel
vision
appears
as
early
as
the
mid
1960s
this
tunnel
vision
is
often
an
unconscious
condition—people
who
have
tunnel
vision
are
so
focused
on
something
that
they
don’t
realize
they
have
tunnel
vision
this
can
be
both
a
strength
and
weakness
in
combat
for
instance
tunnel
vision
may
help
a
soldier
zoom
in
on
their
target
or
mission
but
it
also
exposes
them
to
attacks
on
their
blind
spots
in
contemporary
culture
tunnel
vision
is
frequently
used
as
a
criticism
against
people
or
organizations
who
lose
sight
of
the
big
picture
this
could
be
a
student
whose
tunnel
vision
on
getting
straight
as
could
lead
to
neglect

tunnel
vision
is
also
a
common

expression
to
inspire
pop
culture

electric
current
is
the

most

experienced
in
the
form
of
electricity
any
time
an
object
with
a
net
electric

in

the

moves
very
slowly
pushing
electrons
into

is
rather
like
pushing

a
distinguished
member
of
the
school
declared
that
nothing
was
to
him
more
odious
than
any
manner
of
voluntaryism
and
that
he
hoped
to
see
state
operation
introduced
into
every
department
of
english
social
organization
from

gutenberg
the
reasons
given
for
this
apathy
are
that
a
body
which
had
so
long
wielded
ecclesiastical
power
over
others
by
virtue
of
state
laws
ought
in
its
turn
to
yield
obedience
to
those
laws—that
the
seceders
had
held
on
upon
their
power
so
long
as
they
could
exert
it
in
their
own
way—that
in
the
exercise
of
spiritual
authority
they
had
been
far
from
tolerant
of
dissenters—and
that
at
the
very
moment
of
their
egress
from
the
kirk
they
repudiated
voluntaryism
as
a
principle
and
offered
incense
to
state
church
establishments
from
project
gutenberg
as
to
the
repudiation
of
voluntaryism
while
in
the
very
act
of
secession
it
was
a
concession
to
that
tempting
expediency
which
in
a
crisis
when
principle
and
numbers
are
both
important
yields
some
of
the
former
to
gain
more
of
the
latter
from
project
gutenberg
but
though
justly
celebrated
as
a
preacher
and
a
divine
he
is
more
widely
known
for
his
able
advocacy
of

in
opposition
to

establishments
his
early
and
steady
services
in

negro
emancipation
and
his

liberty

figuring
precisely
how
long
it
takes
to
charge
an
electric
car
is
akin
to
asking
quot;how
long
does
it
take
to
cross
the
country?&quot
it
depends
on
whether
youre
on
a
plane
or
on
foot
recharge
time
is
dependent
on
a
host
of
variables
many
of
them
nuanced—even
the
length
of
the
charging
cable
can
influence
it—that
make
providing
a
precise
answer
impossible
but
we
can
give
you
some
reliable
guidelines
setting
aside
some
of
the
minute
variables
there
are
three
major
factors
that
impact
ev
charging
time
the
power
source
the
vehicles
charger
capacity
and
the
battery
size
ambient
conditions
generally
play
a
smaller
part
though
both
cold
and
hot
weather
extremes
can
considerably
increase
charge
time
porsche
factors
that
affect
charging
time
charger
level
lets
start
with
the
power
source
not
all
electrical
outlets
are
created
equal
the
common
120
volt
15
amp
receptacle
in
a
kitchen
is
to
a
240
volt
outlet
that
powers
an
electric
dryer
as
a
squirt
gun
is
to
a
garden
hose
all
electric
vehicles
can
theoretically
charge
their
large
batteries
off
the
standard
kitchen
outlet
but
imagine
trying
to
fill
a
55
gallon
barrel
with
a
squirt
gun
recharging
an
ev
battery
with
a
120
volt
source—these
are
categorized
as
level
1
according
to
sae
j1772
a
standard
that
engineers
use
to
design
evs—is
measured
in
days
not
hours
if
you
own
or
plan
to
own
an
ev
youll
be
wise
to
consider
having
a
240
volt
level
2
charging
solution
installed
in
your
home
a
typical
level
2
connection
is
240
volts
and
40
to
80
amps
while
fewer
amps
is
still
considered
level
2
a
80
amp
circuit
will
maximize
most
evs
onboard
chargers
more
on
those
in
a
minute
because
if
youre
not
maximizing
the
effectiveness
of
the
vehicles
onboard
chargers
a
lower
than
optimal
power
source
is
essentially
a
restrictor
plate
that
lengthens
the
charge
time
for
the
absolute
fastest
charging
possible
youll
want
to
plug
into
a
level
3
connection
colloquially
known
as
a
dc
fast
charger
these
are
the
ev
equivalent
of
filling
that
barrel
with
a
fire
hose
a
certifiably
lethal
current
of
dc
power
is
pumped
into
the

but
like
all
charging
the
flow
is
throttled
back
when
the
vehicle
batterys
state
of
charge
soc
is
nearing
full
and
vehicles
ability
to
accept
dc
charging
varies
widely
the
porsche
taycan
for
example
can
charge
at
up
to
320
kw
while
a
nissan
ariya
can
manage
only
130

ford
using
a
fast
charger
generally
speaking
when
an
ev
batterys
soc
is
below
10
percent
or
above
80
percent
a
dc
fast
chargers
charging
rate
slows
considerably
this
optimizes
battery
life
and
limits
the
risk
of
overcharging
this
is
why
for
example
manufacturers
often
claim
that
fast
charging
will
get
your
evs
battery
to
quot;80
percent
charge
in
30
minutes.&quot
some
vehicles
have
a
battery
preconditioning
procedure
that
ensures
the
battery
is
at
optimum
temperature
for
rapid
charging
while
en
route
to
a
dc
fast
charger
so
long
as
you
utilize
the
in

navigation
system
to
get
you
there
that
is
maximum

and
driving
range
that
last
20
percent
of

may
double
the
time
youre
hooked
up
to
the
fast

the
time
consuming
affair
of
completely
filling
the
battery
via
a
dc
charger
makes
these
units
best
utilized
on
those
days
when
you
are
traveling
a
long
distance
and
need
additional
electricity
to
reach
your
destination
charging
at
home
overnight–sometimes
called
top
up
charging–is
a
better
solution
for
getting
the
juice
youll
need

local

chevrolet
battery
size
as
the
hunt
for
range
supremacy
continues
the
battery
capacity
of
some
evs
has
ballooned
to
absurd
levels
others
are
targeting
increased
efficiency
this
plays
a
massive
role
in
charging
time
upsize
our
barrel
to
an
85
gallon
unit
even
with
a
fire
hose
itll
still
take
longer
to
fill
than
the
smaller
55

barrel
while
a
gmc
hummer
ev
is
built
on
an
architecture
capable
of
350
kw
intake
filling
its
205.0
kwh
battery
compared
to
the
112.0
kwh
pack
found
in

grand
touring
requires
exponentially
more
time
even
if
the
charging
rate
is
similar
the

travel
over
40
percent
further
on
a
charge
while
having
93.0
kwh
fewer
in
its
battery
pack
than
the
hummer
efficiency
indeed
no
doubt
someday
manufacturers
will
settle
on
a
single
metric
for
expressing
charge
times
but
for
now
know
that
filling
up
an
evs

there
is
a
common
misconception
that
the
thing
you
plug
into
an
electric
car
is
the
quot;charger.&quot
in
fact
theres
a
battery
charger
in
the
car
that
converts
the
ac
electricity
from
the
wall
into
dc
electricity
to
charge
the
battery
onboard
chargers
trickle
power
into
the
battery
pack
safely
and
have
their
own
power
ratings
typically
in
kilowatts
if
a
car
has
a
10.0
kw
charger
and
a
100.0
kwh
battery
pack
it
would
in
theory
take
10
hours
to
charge
a
fully
depleted
battery
to
gauge
the
optimal
charge
time
of
a
specific
ev
you
divide
the
battery
capacitys
kwh
number
by
the
onboard
chargers
power
rating
then
add
10
percent
because
there
are
losses
associated
with
charging
this
is
assuming
the
power
source
can
maximize
the
vehicles
charger
typical
onboard
chargers
are
at
least
6.0
kilowatts
but
some
manufacturers
offer
nearly
twice
that
and
the
cream
of
the
crop
have
more
than
triple
that
figure
the
current
tesla
model

performance
for
instance
has
an
11.5

charger
which
can
take
full
advantage
of
a
240
volt
60

circuit
to
recharge
its
80.8
kwh
battery
while
the
rear
wheel
drive
model
3
comes
with
a
7.6
kw
charger
doing
the
recharge
time
math
indicates
that
it
will
take
nearly
the
same
time
to
fill
the
two
cars
batteries
though
the
performance
models
is
roughly
30
percent
larger
the
beauty
of
a
well
paired
electricity
source
and
onboard
charger
is
that
you
can
plug
your
ev
in
at
home
with
a
nearly
depleted
battery
and
have
a
fully
charged
steed
waiting
for
you
in

you
can
also
find
approximate
recharge
times
on
some
ev
manufacturers
websites
all

there
are
a
wide
range
of
possibilities
when
answering
the
question
of
how
long
it
takes
to
charge
an
ev
in
our

observed
dc
fast

as
low
as
25

over

considering
why
you
want
a

cam
what
features
you
value
and
how
much
youre
willing
to
spend
will
help
determine
which
dash
cam
you
should
buy
before
you
decide
to
pony
up
for
a
pricey
dash
cam—or
conversely
a
less
expensive
model
without
all
the
bells
and
whistles—there
are
a
ton
of
important
factors
to
consider
storage
heres
the
dirty
little
secret
about
dash
cams
many
are
worthless
right
out
of
the
box
after
all
what
good
is
a
dash
cam
if
you
cant
provide
its
footage
to
investigators
later
or
upload
it
to
youtube
or
crashdashes
dash
cams
are
generally
too
small
to
feature
internal
storage
so
they
require
a
micro
sd
card
to
save
footage
the
problem
is
that
most
dont
include
a
memory
card
you
need
to
buy
it
separately
or
upgrade
to
a
bundle
that
includes
one
always
check
to
see
if
the
model
youre
considering
requires
and
comes
with
a
memory
card
and
purchase
one
if
necessary
pro
tip
since
most
card
based
dash
cams
typically
overwrite
older
footage
when
sto
10000
rage
capacity
is
reached
we
recommend
purchasing
a
high
capacity
memory
card
anyway
to
safeguard
against
accidental
deletion
on
the
flip
side
many
modern
dash
cams
utilize
cloud
storage
which
uploads
data
to
a
server
for
remote
storage
cloud
based
dashboard
cameras
generally
require
an
additional
subscription
cost

to

at

but
eliminate
the
need
for

the
cobra
sc
400d
was
the
best
dash
cam
we
tested
thanks
to
its
4k
resolution
we
agreed
that
its
video
footage
genuinely
looked
the
best
too
we
found
the
touchscreen
to
be
easy
to
operate
and
responsive
and
the
cobra
uses
its
proprietary
drivesmarter
app
to
provide
police
alerts
and
other
driver
reports
if
we
had
one
minor
grumble
it
would
be
that
the
mount
only
swivels
forward
and
backward
not
side
to
side
however
the
wide
angle
of
the
lens
practically
eliminates
the
need
to
do
so
the
cobra
secures
to
the
windshield
via
a
large
sticky
pad
for
the
mount
and
a
very
strong
magnet
for
the
camera
itself
of
course
this
kind

the
investor
then
buys
the
same
amount
of
shares
at
the
new
lower
price
finally
the
investor
returns
the
same
amount
of
shares
that
they
borrowed
to
the
broker
at
this
point
the
short
sale
is
complete
the
profit
comes
from
the
difference
between
the
amount
the
investor
originally
sells
the
shares
for
and
the
amount
they
buy
them
back
for
stock
trading
always
includes
some
risk
for
example
when
you
take
a
long
position
on
a
stock
in
the
hopes
that
its
price
will
increase
and
you
can
sell
the
shares
at
a
profit
there’s
no
guarantee
that
it
will
increase
in
price
but
your
risk
in
this
case
is
limited
to
the
amount
you
originally
paid
for
the
shares
in
contrast
a
short
sale
is
infinitely
riskier
because
of
the
possibility
that
the
stock
might
increase
in
price
forcing
the
investor—who
is
required
to
buy
it
back
and
return
it
by
a
certain
date—to
pay
extreme
amounts
in
order
to
meet
these
requirements
for
this
reason
the
risk
is
literally
unlimited
one
of
the
worst
case
scenarios
for
a
short
seller
is
to
get
caught
in
what’s
called
a
short
squeeze
what
is
a
short
squeeze
to
understand
it
you
first
need
to
remember
that
a
short
sale
requires
the
short
seller
to
wait
for
the
price
to
go
down
before
buying
back
shares
in
order
to
return
them
but
what
happens
when
the
price
goes
up
and
keeps
going
up
if
the
deadline
for
the
return
of
the
shares
is
approaching
the
investor
is
forced
to
buy
the
shares
at
the
increased
price
before
it
surges
even
higher
the
short
seller
is
being
pressured
squeezed
into
buying
the
stock
most
likely
at
a
big
loss
sometimes
a
short
squeeze
is
the
result
of
a
coordinated
effort
by
some
investors
to
buy
large
amounts
of
a
stock
that
has
been
the
target
of
a
short
sale
thus
driving
the
price
up
and
up
due
to
the
demand
from
the
short
sellers
to
buy
it
back
this
use
of
the
word
short
in
the
context
of
stock
trading
dates
back
to
the
mid
1800s
in
this
context
the
word
short
was
originally
used
in
the
sense
of
a
person
selling
stock
that
they
didn’t
actually
have
they
were
short
of
stock
in
the
same
way
a
person
is
said
to
be
short
or
short
of
cash
when
they
don’t
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
something
example
of
a
short
sale
you’ve
been
doing
your
research
and
you
think
that
biffco
enterprises
is
going
to
have
a
poor
quarter
for
profits
resulting
in
a
decrease
in
its
stock
price
through
a
broker
you
borrow
100
shares
of
biffco
stock
which
is
currently
selling
for
3
a
share
then
you
quickly
sell
those
100
shares
to
a
buyer
for
300
then
you
wait
closely
watching
the
price
of
biffco
shares
you
were
right—their
share
price
dropped
to
1
per
share
you
now
buy
back
100
shares
of
biffco
stock
for
100
return
them
to
the
broker
and
pocket
the
remaining
200
in
profit
from
the
short
sale
short

used
in
a
sentence
a

the
brick

why
is
short
sale
trending
the
term
short
sale
started
trending
in
january
2021
as
a
result
of
a
short
squeeze
caused
by
investors
buying
large
amounts
of
stock
in
gamestop
stock
abbrev
gme
a
company
that
owns
a
chain
of
video
games
retail
stores
due
to
the
shift
to
online
shopping
and
digital
markets
the
companies
behind
brick
and
mortar
stores
like
gamestop
are
often
seen
as
being
in
decline
this
has
made
their
stock
a
target
for
short
sales
in
particular
by
major
hedge
funds
investment
firms
that
specialize
in
high
risk
investment
strategies
like
short
sales
here’s
where
it
gets
interesting
some
stock
trading
enthusiasts
became
aware
of
some
hedge
funds
short
positions
on
gamestop
and
other
stocks
and
decided
to
take
the
risky
move
of
trying
to
exploit
those
positions
this
effort
was
led
by
a
community
of
amateur
stock
traders
on
the
social
media
site
reddit
specifically
the
subreddit
forum
r/wallstreetbets
their
plan
involved
buying
large
amounts
of
gamestop
stock
using
online
trading
platforms
such
as
robinhood
the
sudden
buying
spree
caused
gamestop
stock
to
quickly
rocket
upward
in
price
the
result
was
a
short
squeeze
in
which
the
price
continued
to
climb
as
short
sellers
notably
the
hedge
funds
desperately
tried
to
buy
back
shares
before
the
price
increased
even
more
this
situation
continued
to
escalate
and
gain
mainstream
attention
causing
gamestop
stock
to
become
widely
discussed
as
a
meme
stock”—one
that
has
seen
an
increase
in
trading
activity
after
gaining
popularity
due
to
some
online
trend
as
if
the
stock
has
gone
viral
traders
then
began
buying
shares
in
other
companies
that
hedge
funds
had
targeted
as
safe
bets
for
short
sales

amc

said
teya
bodger
an
eighth
grade
competitor
from
brandon
south

who
wants
to
be
an
astrophotographer
from
washington
times
he
sat
on
a
log
staring
into

and
he
too
remembered
this
time
last
year—when
he
had
tried
to
train
bodger
as
a

by
throwing
a
stuffed
leather
glove

followed
by
deepening
deafness
limping
paws
and
an
unbearable

and
terminated
two
days
running
so
subtly
by
bodger’s
appearance
out
of
the
bush
with
a
diligent
puzzled
expression—but
no
leather
glove
from
literature
nor
could
he
understand
how
such
a
distinctive
trio
could
pass
unremarked
in
this
small
community
he
had
already
spoken
to
some
of
bodger’s
friends
at
the
school
and
not

sharp
eyed
child
had
seen
them
that
last
morning
or

in

anything
out
of

ordinary
and
longridge
knew
that
the
area
covered
by
rural
school
children
was
immense
from
literature
peter
had
smiled
for
the
first
time
on
hearing
this
it
had
conjured
up
for
him
a
vivid
picture
of
bodger
in
his
aggressive
element
thoroughly
enjoying
himself
in
a
fight
cheerfully
wicked
and
unrepentant
as
ever
from
literature
his
deep
grief
he
kept
to
himself
and
would
not
undermine
it
now
with
this
softening
hope
bodger
was

from
used

likely

john

green’s

records

roughly

included
an

alex
karras
while
this
mongo
may
draw
from
the

of

the

apparently
a

mongo

are
still
sometimes
used
as
insults
similar

in
2011
comedian
ricky
gervais
was
widely
criticized
for
using
mong
as
an

although
gervais
argued
that
the

had
shifted
and
he
would
never
use
it

a
bbc

compared
gervais’s
mong
to
the
use
of

spread
in
the
2000s
quickly
embraced
by
dads
in
need
of
validation
and
by
content
creators
seeing
some
opportunity
in
their
humor

this
joke’s
for
you
the
best
dad
jokes
from
the
funniest
comedians
the
website
dadsbadjokes.com
launched
in
2006
in
2009
a
facebook
page
dad
jokes
started
eventually
gaining
over
80,000
followers
the
irony
of
course
is
that
all
those
unfunny
dad
jokes
became
beloved
by
the
2010s
dad
joke
came
to
signify
any
corny
joke
especially
a
punny
one
liner
perhaps
associated
with
grade
schoolers
e.g
why
didn’t
the
skeleton
go
to
the
dance
he
had
no
body
to
go
with
the
popularity
of
the
dad
joke
coincides
with
other
dad
terms
such
as
dad
bod
the
slight
pudge
of
a
middle
age
man)—all
perhaps
prompted
by
millennials
starting
to
have
families
themselves
how
is
dad
joke
used
in
real
life
there’s
a
subtle
but
important
difference
between
a
dad
joke
and
a
bad
joke
they
can
have
much
in
common
yes
but
the
dad
joke
is
associated
with
an
out
of
touch
but
well
meaning
and
warm
older
man
trying
to
tease
fool
or
downright
irritate
his
family
dad
jokes
though
have
an
endearing
and
nostalgic
quality
too
and
a
dad
joke
as
noted
isn’t
the
exclusive
domain
of
actual
fathers
more
examples
of
dad
joke
everyone
can
appreciate
a
few
classic
bad
dad
jokes
especially
with
father’s
day

states
of

because
many
physical
properties
are
quantized
taking
on
only
discrete
distinct
values
quantum
numbers
are
generally
integers
or
simple
fractions
rather
than
continuous
ranges
one
of
the
great
successes
of
quantum
mechanics
is
its
account
of
the
structure
of
electron
orbits
around
atomic
nuclei
and
the
state
of
an
electron
in
this
particular
system
can
be
described
using
four
quantum
numbers
these
are
the
principal
or

quantum
number
the
orbital
azimuthal
or
second
quantum
number
the
magnetic
quantum
number
and
the
spin
or
spin
magnetic
quantum
number
the
principal
quantum
number
designated
n
characterizes
the
basic
energy
level
for
the
electron
and
indicates
in
which
shell
the
electron
is
located
it
has
integer
values
starting
at
1
the
higher
the
number
the
farther
the
electron
is
from
the
nucleus
the
principal
quantum
numbers
correspond
to
the
traditional
orbital
shell
designations
k
l
m
and
so
on
used
in
chemistry
the
orbital
quantum
number
designated
l
characterizes
the
angular
momentum
and
determines
the
shape
of
it
orbit
its
possible
values
for
a
given
electron
depend
on
the
value
of
that
principal
quantum
numbers
ranging
from
0
to
n
1
because
of
these
different
possibilities
shells
other
than
the
first
shell

subshells
these
are
traditionally
designated
s

d

l

f
where
l
3
the
magnetic
quantum
number
designated
m
or
ml
takes
on
integer
values
between
l
and
l
and
indicates
the
orientation
of
the
orbit
within
the
subshell
for
example
there
are
three
orbitals
in
the
p
subshell
designated
as
p
x
p
y
and
p
z
finally
the
spin
quantum
number
designated
ms
characterizes
the
spin
direction
of
the
electron
it
can
have
values
of
1
2
or

2
electrons
are
fermions
meaning
that
no
two
electrons
can
be
in
the
same
quantum
state
due
to
the
pauli
exclusion
principle
therefore
each
electron
in
an
atom
is
uniquely
characterized
by
a
set
of
these
four
quantum
numbers
in
fact
the
chemical
properties
of
atoms
depend
almost
entirely
on
the
quantum
numbers
associated
with
their
electrons
other
quantum
numbers

systems

like

come
in

the

miata
is
a
go

for
adults

it
pales
in
comparison
to
the
violent
roar
of

chevrolet
corvette
z06
comparing
the
two
against
each
other
pits
apples
against

but
both
convertibles
are
capable
of
raising
your
heart
rate
at
the
cost
of
a
little
chassis
stiffness
not
to
mention
the
additional
equipment
required
for
track
days
convertibles
do
away
with
some
of
the
interference
between
the
tailpipes
and
your
ears
as
well
as
your
hair
or
for
some
us
scalp
and
the
sky
above
whether
this
is
a
blessing
or
a
curse
depends
on
the
length
of
your

and
the
weather
that
defines
the
area

weve
lifted
every

lid
pressed

and
studied
these
droptops
as

in

the
difference
between

is
all
business
dense
muscular
bodywork
haunches
down
over
massive
tires
an
exaggerated
but
functional
front
aerodynamic
appliance
manages
airflow
and
a
quartet
of
exhaust
pipes
announces
the
arrival
of
its
twin
turbo
inline
six
engine
with
blaring
intensity
unlike
its
coupe
counterpart
the
m4
convertible
exclusively
comes
standard
with
all
wheel
drive
and
in
competition
guise
a
combo
that
brings
523
horses
to
the
table
the
base
m4
coupe
makes
just
473
horsepower
while
rear
drive
m4
competition
coupes
pack
503
horses
an
eight
speed
automatic
is
the
sole
transmission
on
offer
the
m4s
suspension
is
tuned
for
performance
and
itll
reward
you
with
stupendous
levels
of
grip
on
twisty
backroads
just
know
that
every
pothole
and
road
imperfection
will
remind
you

car
and

chevrolet
offers
the
corvette
convertible
in
a
variety
of
configurations
that
go
from
mild
to
wild
the
mildest
variant
dons
the
stingray
nomenclature
and
comes
with
a
490
hp
6.2
liter
v
8
engine
mounted
behind
the
cabin
sadly
you
cant
get
a
corvette
with
a
stick
shift
but
the
eight
speed
automatic
does
a
great
job
of
choosing
gears
and
provides
satisfyingly
quick
shifts
when
you
use
the
steering
wheel
mounted
shift
paddles
handling
is
downright
heroic
so
balanced
and
lithe
that
it
urges
you
to
push
harder
and
harder
into
each
successive
corner
but
horsepower
and
high
speed
cornering
confidence
are
only
part
of
the
equation
the
corvette
stingray
is
also
easily
capable
of
taking
on
the
duty
of
a
daily
driver
thanks
to
its
comfortable
cabin
and
agreeable
ride
worthy
of
a
2025
10best
award
on
performance
capability
alone
its
versatility
makes
it
a
lock
need
a
little
more
oomph
then
check
out
the
gasoline
electric
e
ray
that
pairs
the
stingrays
v
8
with
an
electric
motor
that
drives
the
front
wheels
a
combination
thats
good
for
a
peak
of
655
horses
or

the

mazda
has
been
perfecting
the
miata
formula
for
more
than
three
decades
and
the
result
is
an
affordable
sports
car
thats
a
highly
polished
gem
whether
as
a
classic
soft
top
roadster
or
as
the
rf
retractable
fastback
with
a
power

the
miata
brings
the

catalog
of
virtues—and
a

its

liter
four
cylinder
loves
to
rev
and
is
best
enjoyed
with
the
easy
shifting
six

manual
gearbox
although
an
automatic

available
direct
responsive
steering
guides
an
athletic
chassis
although
it
doesn’t
serve
up
t
he
most
cosseting
ride
over
bombed
out
pavement
the
cabin
is
nicely
finished
but
can
be
a
tight
fit
for
tall
drivers
and
cabin
stowage
space
is
at
a
premium
the
trunk
is
tiny
too
making
the
miata
less
than
ideal
for
long
distance
two
person
road
trips
instead
point
it
down
a
twisty
road
drop
the
top
and
revel
in
the
purity

goodison
park
is
one
of
the
grand
sporting
theatres
and
the
final
merseyside
derby
played
out
at
the
old
place
delivered
the
dramatic
last
act
it
deserved
before
the
doors
are
finally
locked
the
concluding
scenes
included
a
98th
minute
equaliser
from
james
tarkowski
only
given
after
the
stadium
held
its
breath
for
several
minutes
while
the
video
assistant
referee
checked
for
offside
and
a
foul
and
then
when
the
goal
was
awarded
to
give
everton
a
deserved
2
2
draw
tempers
boiled
over
with
abdoulaye
doucoure
needlessly
taunting
fans
to
the
annoyance
of
curtis
jones
sparking
a
full
on
brawl
that
saw
both
sent
off
they
were
followed
by
liverpool
head
coach
arne
slot
and
his
assistant
sipke
hulshoff
who
were
furious
with
referee
michael
oliver
as
this
derby
descended
into
chaos
with
police
stewards
and
players
all
involved
everton
manager
david
moyes
said
quot;it
was
mayhem
all
game
a
bit
of
a
throwback
the
place
was
boiling
hot
all
night
it
was
an
incredible
atmosphere.&quot
and
in
those
few
words
moyes
summed
up
the
special
magic
of
goodison
park
it
may
be
creaking
in
parts
but
on
fiery
nights
like
this
with
liverpool
as
the
opposition
it
literally
rocks
parts
of
it
really
do
with
a
glorious
support
and
naked
hostility
like
few
other
places
in
world
football
everton
may
have
that
state
of
the
art
new
stadium
on
bramley
moore
dock
ready
to
go
next
season
but
it
is
an
almost
impossible
task
to
replicate
what
they
have
in
this
place
ramshackle
and
old
fashioned
in
parts
admittedly
hence
the
need
to
move
goodison
park
was
never
going
to
go
quietly
but
this
was
something
else
full
of
emotion
passion
and
all
the
wild
scenes
of
indiscipline
moyes
called
quot;to
ing
and
fro
ing&quot
after
the
final
whistle
it
may
have
pillars
blocking
some
of
the
views
but
it
still
has
so
much
that
will
be
missed
with
its
towering
main
stand
and
the
criss
cross
designs
on
the
stands
that
are
the
trademark
of
famous
scottish
architect
archibald
leitch

a
heart

angry
scenes
erupted
at
the
end
of
the
final
merseyside
derby
at
goodison
park
hours
before
the
game
the
special
feel
around
this
last
derby
was
in
the
air
as
supporters
gathered
around
the
statue
commemorating
william
ralph
dean
standing
on
the
corner
of
walton
lane
and
goodison
road
it
was
the
same
around
holy
trinity

celebrating
the
legendary
1970
title
winning
trio
of
alan
ball
howard
kendall
and
colin
harvey
opposite
st
luke
the
evangelist
church
and
on
the
corner
of
gwladys
street
those
monuments
will
stay
in
place
as
part
of
the
goodison
legacy
project
which
is
hoped
will
regenerate
the
local
community
in
future
years
everton
feeling
this
is
only
right
because
goodison
park
is
the
place
where
their
greatest
feats
were
performed
and
centre
circle
will
also
stay
as
green
space
not
least
because
the
area
is
regarded
as
sacrosanct
as
this
is
where
the
ashes
of
dean

383

who
is
still
in

books
for

60
league
goals
in

28
were
scattered
following
his
death
at
a
merseyside
derby
in
march
1980
things
will
change
when
everton
put
the
locks
on
goodison
park
behind
them
but
some
things
will
stay
the
same
as
something
to
remember
it
by
everton
and
liverpool
supporters
were
making
their
way
through
stanley
park
the
picturesque
patch
of
green
that
separates
anfield
towering
on
one
side
and
goodison
park
emerging
into
sight
on
the
other
hours

goodison
gwladys
street
end
was
in
full
cry
for
the
final
merseyside
derby
at
the
stadium
before
kick
off
the
sounds
of
tribalism
emerged
from
everton
strongholds
the
blue
house
and
the
winslow
hotel
standing
directly
opposite
the
main
stand
on
goodison
road
with
its
howard
kendall
bar
these
are
the
places
so
many
everton
supporters
will
miss
not
as
much
as
goodison
park
itself
but
the
time
honoured
rituals
that
take
place
after
weaving
their
way
through
the
terraced
houses
that
landlock
the
stadium
in
winslow
street
eton
street
neston
street
and
andrew
street
little
did
they
realise
what
this
emotionally
charged
night
held
in
store
for
them
as
everton
rejuvenated
under
moyes
stood
toe
to
toe
with
liverpool
fighting
to
the
end
to
ensure
the
final
tally
of
120
derbies
at
goodison
park
ended
with
41
wins
a
piece
blue
smoke
and
the
smell
of
cordite
filled
the
air
as
team
coach
arrived
the
area
around
the
players
entrance
packed
with
supporters
it
was
spine
tingling
as
the
newer
everton
tradition
of
an
air
raid
siren
blared
before
z
cars
the
soundtrack
to
the
start
of
every
goodison
park
game
rang
out
the
gwladys
street
end
the
heartbeat
of
support
was
covered
in
flags
before
kick
off
including
banners
reading
quot;we
built
this
city
1878&quot
quot;our
motto
is
our
standard
nil
satis
nisi
optimum&quot
and
one
dedicated
to
goodison
with
a
beatles
twist
declaring
quot;there
are
places
remember
1892
2025&quot
it
was
poignant
as
everton
now
have
only
six
games
left
at
the
place
they
have
long
called
home
the
reborn
beto
gave
everton
the
lead
after
11
minutes
but
a
sometimes
unsettled
and
off
colour
liverpool
looked
to
have
secured
the
three
points
through
alex
mac
allister
and
mohamed
salah
before
the
drama
of
equaliser
in
the
closing
seconds
and
the
ugly
brawl
that
followed
the
strains
of
elton
i
guess
why
they
call
it
the
blues
rang
around
an
exultant
goodison
park
after
the
final
whistle
and
there
back
on
familiar
ground
in
the
goodison
park
technical
area
was
moyes
prowling
in
familiar
fashion
as
his
everton
fought
showing
his
desire
still
burns
as
he
celebrated
joyously
and
drove
his
team
on
moyes
is
also
remembered
on
goodison
exterior
cyclical
nature
illustrated
by
his
image
on
the
everton
timeline
that
snakes
its
way
around
the
stadium
commemorating
moments
of
significance
in
the
history
opposite
the
blue
dragon
fish
bar
and
the
goodison
cafe
all
part
of
the
sights

of

is
the
large
photograph
of
a
38
year
old
red
headed
david
moyes
holding
up
an
everton
scarf
after
his
appointment
as
manager
in
march
2002
the
hair
is
now
white
as
moyes
23
years
on
and
soaked
in
a
lifetime
of
managerial
experience
is
back
in
charge
of
everton
for
his
26th
merseyside
derby
he
did
not
want
to
leave
goodison
park
on
a
losing
note
against
liverpool
everton
deserving
their
share
of
the
points
quot;i
think
it
was
hugely
important
that
evertonians
get
to
finish
at
their
stadium
as
best
as
they
can,&quot
he
said
quot;i
just
feel
the
support
in
here
was
unbelievable
it
was
incredible
support
and
i
think
it
was
fitting
they
got
an
end
like
they
did.&quot
this
night
belonged
mostly
to
everton
who
fought
with
character
and
steel
to
get
a
draw
with
liverpool
frustrated
even
though
they
still
lead
the

you’ll

you

so
which

all
serve

loosening

within

there
are

at

the

is
the

but
whats
the

that’s
a

as

we

it—you
have
your
go

purchases
like

soap
but
now
that

it
may

we’re

it
quickly
became

preparing
for
this
test
that
objectively
comparing
15
to
20
different
carwash
soaps
and
their
various
types
and
iterations
was
unrealistic—the
choices
are
so
vast
and
varied
and
preferences
so
subjective
to
the

that
wed
effectively
be
comparing

we
broke

down

four
main

many
of
todays
carwash
soaps
go
beyond
simple
cleanser
after
considering
dozens
of

products
our

showed
that
the

carwash
soap
each
type
has
its
abilities
and
drawbacks
and
all
have
their
pros
and
cons
with
so
many
claims
and
promises
just
scoping
the
shelves
can
be
overwhelming
comparing
them
downright
impossible
so
instead
of
resolutely
pronouncing
that
quot;this
soap
works
better
than
that
one&quot
or
objectively
naming
one
quot;the
best,&quot
were
here
to
help
explain
and
differentiate
between
each
of
these
four
main
types
of
carwashing
soap
things
to
consider
when
buying
car
wash
soap
there
are
lots
of
factors
to
consider
when
buying
carwash
but
the
number
one
issue
according
to
kosilla
is
quot;what
are
you
trying
to
clean?&quot
there
are
soaps
for
almost
every
component
and
material
on
your
car
for
this
comparison
well
stick
to
general
carwash
soaps
not
component
cleaners
heres
what
to
look
for
ph
balance
in
general
look
for
a
soap
thats
ph
balanced
to
ensure
it
cleans
the
whole
car
without
damaging
wax
paintwork
or
components
depending
on
where
you
live
and
how
you
drive
though
there
may
be
other
ph
considerations
quot;if
youre
in
alaska
where
you
have
lots
of
road
salt,&quot
says
kosilla
quot;you
might
want
to
get
something
that
has
a
lower
ph
to
attack
the
minerals
and
remove
the
salts
from
the
surface
just
like
you
would
on
your
hair
if
youre
in
florida
and
the
roads
have
tar
and
its
a
hundred
thousand
degrees
or
whatever
youre
going
to
want
a
high
ph
based
soap.&quot
but
these
are
extremes
for
the
most
part
kosilla
says
a
neutral
ph
balance
is
your
best
bet
quot;ph
neutral
soaps
are
the
safest
and
are
not
going
to
do
anything
drastic
to
the
paint
or
whatever
is
covering
the
paint,&quot
says
kosilla
concentration/value
a
more
concentrated
soap
will
last
longer
and
potentially
offer
better
value
for
money
depending
on
the
price
per
ounce
and
dilution
requirements
use
some
basic
math
to
check
how
much
product
is
required
for
each
wash
to
determine
the
rough
per
wash
price
compatibility
with
washing
tools
take
into
consideration
the
tools
you
have
on
hand
and
your
personal
preference
for
washing
your
car
some
soaps
are
specially
formulated
for
use
with
foam
guns
or
cannons
while
others
are
best
applied
by
hand
environmental
impact
many
brands
now
offer
eco
friendly
options
with
fewer
compromises
on
cleaning
power
and
functionality
look
for
biodegradable
formulas
to
be
environmentally
conscious
finish
and
protection
besides
cleaning
consider
what
additional
benefits
the
soap
offers
such
as
added
wax
for
protection
or
ingredients
that
enhance
shine
additives
counterintuitively
if
you
plan
to
add
a
wax
or
ceramic
coating
after
your
carwash
it
might
make
more
sense
to
buy
regular
car
soap
to
get
your
car
completely
clean
before
you
spiff
it
up
with
other
products
otherwise
youll
end
up
applying
additional
wax
or
ceramic
coating
on
top
of
the
stuff
thats
already
in
the
soap
washing
method
as
kosilla
noted
carwashing
quot;is
so
much
more
important
than
the
actual
product
we
can
argue
about
the
products
all
day
long,&quot
larry
admits
quot;but
if
you
have
the
best
product
in
the
world
and
have
a
horrible
method
the
soap
doesnt
matter.&quot
to
avoid
spreading
contaminants
youll
want
to
make
sure
youre
minimizing
the
risk
of
grinding
dirt
and
debris
into
the
car
as
such
youll
want
to
use
one
of
two
washing
methods
the
two
bucket
method
or
utilize
a
grit
guard
the
two
bucket
method
utilizes
one
bucket
for
your
soap
solution
and
one
for
rinsing
your
wash
mitt
a
grit
guard
fits
at
the
bottom
of
a
bucket
to
help
trap
contaminants
that
may
scratch
your
rides
paint
at
the
end
of
the
day
kosilla
admits
the
distinctions
between
carwash
soaps
are
often
cosmetic
rather
than
chemical
quot;for
the
average
person
that
just
wants
to
wash
their
regular
car
that
they
use
for
regular
things
all
carwashes
are
more
or
less
in
the
same
ballpark—what
youre
changing
is
some
lubrication
definitely
fragrance
definitely
colors
and
things
and
obviously
the
biggest
one
of
all
is
price,&quot
he
says
quot;everybodys
focused
on
whats
the
cheapest,&quot
kosilla
says
quot;but
when
people
are
focused
on
price
only
thats
what
theyre
going
to
get.&quot
how
we
tested
car
wash
soap
gannon
burgett
car
and
driver
car
wash
soap
may
seem
like
a
single
category
but
it
breaks
down
into
several
subcategories
each
with
its
own
unique
additives
and
purposes
we
debated
quite
a
bit
about
how
to
compare
these
different
formulas
fairly
after
all
you
wouldn’t
compare
a
whitening
toothpaste
to
one
designed
for
sensitive
relief
since
each
is
chosen
based
on
the
users
needs
and
while
we’re
not
talking
about
teeth
here
coming
up
with
a
testing
plan
felt
like
pulling
them
so
we’re
going
to
go
ahead
and
say
that
car
wash
soap
works
the
same
way
there
are
different
formulas
for
different
needs
you
get
the
idea
with
this
in
mind
we
decided
to
focus
on
four
main
types
and
test
them
using
products
from
a
single
brand
mother
polish
for
the
record
this
is
not
a
sponsored
test
we
purchased
these
products
ourselves
mothers
was
selected
for
both
its
reputation
and
because
it
provides
a
full
range
of
soap
types
each
soap
was
mixed
according
to
its
instructions
and
tested
using
a
traditional
bucket
and
mitt
wash
method
with
agrit
guard
to
ensure
best
practice
we
rinsed
and
replaced
the
wash
bucket
and
mitt
between
tests
using
one
soap
type
per
panel
during
our
tests
we
evaluated
each
formula
based
on
difference
in
additives
texture
cleaning
effectiveness
and
water
runoff
sudsing
ability
our
goal
was
to
determine
whether
there
were
noticeable
distinctions
between
these
four
types
and
whether
any
of
them
clearly
outperformed
the
rest
note
the
products
listed
under
each
soap
type
are
merely
examples
of
each
we
used
mothers
products
as
our
baseline
the
other
car
soaps
are
merely
gear
t
eam
recommendations
regular
carwash
soap
gannon
burgett
car
and
driver
lets
start
with
the
most
basic
and
typically
cheapest
type
of
carwash
soap
its
old
school—lacking
any
sort
of
wax
or
ceramic
additives
that
claim
to
be
quot;new
and
improved.&quot
just
simple
sudsy
goodness
that
wont
break
the
bank
but
how
did
it
hold
up
against
the
new
kids
on
the
block
pretty
darn
well
as
it
turns
out
ironically
simple
car
soap
might
not
be
your
idea
of
the
quot;best&quot
type
of
carwash
soap
but
its
usually
among
the
go
to
for
detailers
and
professional
car
care
folks
of
course
the
one
downside
to
using
pure
car
soap
is
a
lack
of
protectants
this
does
cause
the
entire
car
washing
process
to
become
longer
but
pros
know
this
is
a
good
thing
because
this
kind
of
soap
doesnt
leave
any
additives
behind
you
can
apply
the
wax
or
coating
of
your
choice—which
is
nearly
always
better
than
the
stuff
included
in
soaps
if
this
sounds
like
you
look
into
simple
no
frills
regular
carwash
soap
but
if
time
is
a
concern
when
it
comes
to
washing
and
waxing
your
ride
consider
a
carwash
soap
with
additives

car

strike
a

between
price
and

if
you’re
not
chasing
perfection
but
still
want
a
clean
car
that
repels
water
and
grime
this
is
the
way
to
go
during
testing
we
noticed
that
these
soaps
had
a
thicker
almost
honey
like
viscosity
requiring
more
mixing
with
water
than
the
standard
car
wash
the
suds
and
water
felt
a
little
waxy
enough
to
dry
out
our
hands
that
same
waxy
quality
however
is
what
helps
provide
the
extra
protection
and
speeds
up
drying
according
to
kosilla
these
formulas
allow
water
to
bead
off
the
surface
more
quickly
once
rinsed
that
said
it’s
important
to
keep
expectations
in
check
while
these
soaps
include
wax
they
won’t
provide
the
same
level
of
protection
as
a
dedicated
wax
application
if
you
put
a
wax
sealant
on
afterward
you’re
better
off
using
a
standard
soap
with
the
wax
application
afterward
however
if
you’re
short
on
time
and
want
a
quick
shine
with
some
added
hydrophobic
properties
a
car
wash
soap
with
a
wax
is
a
solid
choice
also
you
will
find
different
wax
types
in
these
formulas—synthetic
and
carnauba
synthetic
waxes
are
chemically
altered
formulas
while
carnauba
wax
is
a
natural
alternative
without
chemical
alterations
choosing
between
them
comes
down
to
personal
preference
but
either
way
you’ll

hybrid

soap
gannon

car
and
driver
enter
the
new
age
hybrid
car
soap
is
simply
the
more
refined
quot;better&quot
wash
and
wax
soap
or
is
it
while
kosilla
is
dubious
of
pure
ceramic
soaps
he
says
regarding
hybrid
soaps
quot;on
the
flip
side
if
you
want
to
have
wax
in
there
i
think
those
actually
do
work.&quot

their
product
quot;ceramic,&quot
manufacturers
typically
add
sio2
silicon
dioxide
to
the
soap
for
a
claimed
higher
cleaning
and
protection
level
we
did
not
find
as
big
of
a
difference
between
the
hybrid
and
soap
wax
products
as
manufacturers
marketing
jargon
might
suggest
hybrid
soap
is
definitely
thinner
and
less
sudsy
but
we
didnt
notice
a
huge
improvement
in
drying
time
its
selling
point
is
paint
and
finish
protection
so
its
a
nice
way
to
add
a
bit
of
that
without
shelling
hundreds
for
a
full

hybrid
car
soap
also
falls
into
the
time

for
time
why
not
do
both
steps
at
