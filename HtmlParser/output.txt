Widen
After
Impeachment
Vote
Some
House
Republicans
have
called
on
Representative
Liz
Cheney
to
resign
from
her
leadership
post
after
she
voted
to
impeach
President
Trump.
Ms.
Cheney
was
one
of
10
Republicans
to
break
with
the
party
on
the
vote,
setting
up
a
messy
internal
feud
that
could
define
its
future.
President-elect
Joe
Biden
has
stayed
largely
removed
from
the
fray
of
the
impeachment
and
kept
his
focus
on
the
pandemic
and
the
economy.
Here’s
